        <p>I Want to introduce myself as a person. You may also be a person but I am the person... who wrote these words.</p>
        <p>I was never really told to write much here so that doesn't make me much of a different person than you</p>
        <p>That is alright though because we all know what person we are. If you are still trying to figure that out then don't worry too much since that is for the birds.</p>
        <p>That is all I have for you, you person. This person with now personaly bid you adieu</p>
